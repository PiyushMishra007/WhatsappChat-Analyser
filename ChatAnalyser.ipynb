He went to Lotus Hospital, Agra for a general check-up where he was informed by Doctors that he has already suffered a minor heart attack.  Gyan sir collapsed where he was sitting. He was immediately taken to the emergency ward as he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and was put on life support. He was revived by CPR. Cardiac arrest caused ‘Brain Hypoxia’ which leads to major brain damage.
